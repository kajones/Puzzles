Big O Notation is a way of representing the *maximum* expected duration for an algorithm

O(1) means the algorithm will take the same duration regardless of the size of the data
     e.g. checking on the first element in an array

O(n) means that the algorithm will take a time proportional to the size of the data 
     (i.e. the duration will grow linearly in relation to the size of the data)
	 e.g. checking for the existence of a particular element in an array

O(n^2) means that the algorithm will take a time proportional to the square of the size of the data
     - this is often the case where you will have a nested loop going through all the elements of the array
	   because for each item in n you do n operations
	 - also naive bubble sort

O(n^x) means that the algorithm will take a time proportional to the xth power of the size of the data
        e.g. x nested loops

O(2^n) is where the duration will grow exponentially based on the size of the data
       e.g. calculating the Fibonacci series

O(log n) e.g. finding an item in a sorted array using binary search
